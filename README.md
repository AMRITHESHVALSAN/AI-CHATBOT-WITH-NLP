AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP
Developed an NLP Chatbot using Python Libraries (TensorFlow, Keras):
This project involved building and training a Machine Learning model for intent classification using popular Python libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization and lemmatization were employed for data pre-processing and feature engineering (bag-of-words). 

Implemented Intent Classification and Response Generation:
The chatbot architecture was designed to classify user intents and generate appropriate responses.
The model was trained on a dataset of intents and corresponding responses, enabling it to understand user queries and provide relevant information.
Implemented techniques like tokenization and lemmatization to prepare text data.
